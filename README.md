# text-layout
Wenfei Lin

This project on text layout builds off the class interface TextBlocks to create various implementations of TextBlocks that can be used to build more complex blocks of text, print them, and compare two blocks of text (with regard to how they were built, if they look the same, and if they occupy the same space in memory).
