Changes made in TextBlockTests.java:
- Cleaned up testing file
- Created each type of text block with another different type of text block and with its own type and tested them all
- Factored out the tests into individual methods by text box type 
- Changed some variable names to clearly express what the text box looks like
- Made sure to cover edge cases with empty versions (or empty blocks) of each type (instead of with emptyBox)
